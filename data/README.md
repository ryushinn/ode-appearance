To run our codebase, please donwload the first two ready-to-use datasets.

## Capture Setup

For those interested in capturing flash-lit time-lapse videos on their own, our setup is lightweight and accessible, requiring only:

1. A (programmable) camera with a flashlight close to the lens (co-located). Typically, your smartphone will suffice. For iPhone, we recommend using the [CameraPixels](https://camerapixels.app/) app;
2. A tripod to stabilize the camera;
3. An optical cover to block unwanted ambient lighting;
4. Your time-varying materials of interest. We provide [some protocols](#sources) to reproduce the materials we captured.

| decaying_melon        | Captured by us from 2023 Oct 7 to Nov 13                                   |

For dynamic flash textures, we capture all in real world except seven synthetic data created in Blender using free resources in [BlenderKit](https://www.blenderkit.com/). Original Blender scenes can be found in the raw data.

We provide some reference instructions to reproduce our captured phenomena.
These instructions are mainly descriptive references without precise procedures.
They indicate the types of temporally varying physical properties included in our dataset: surface bumps, metallicity, wetness, and temperature.
